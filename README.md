# jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

I created a monthly salary calculator which takes employee information in inputs on the left side of the screen, stores that information as an object in an array with all other employees. After information if gathered it is displayed on the employees table on the DOM. Each employee generates a delete button with an index of that employee in the array of employees. Clicking the delete button removes the employee object from the array of employees, subtracts their salary from the running total budget count at the top of the screen and removes that employees data from the table. If the total employee salaries exceeds $20000, the background of the total monthly salary are will turn red, indicating that the company is over budget for the month.

If any field is left blank and the submit button is clicked, no data will be stored in the object and a small pop-up will appear below the submit button informing the user that all information must be filled out before they can continue.

Color scheme was supposed to evoke the feeling of money, but ended up looking like the salary calculator at a Sprite bottling plant. I am ok with that, I frequently obey my thirst.
